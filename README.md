Peyronie's disease treatment in india What is Peyronie's ?    Peyronie’s disease is a condition where scar tissue causes the penis to curve or lose length or girth. In some cases, it can cause pain and prevent the man from having sex. There are surgical and nonsurgical treatments that can manage it and it doesn’t cause any harm to the rest of the body. Peyronie’s disease is not cancerous and it doesn’t affect fertility.  How does the penis work? Your penis has two roles: to carry urine and to carry sperm. There are three tubes inside it: the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder and through the penis, and two tubes called the corpora cavernosa that fill with blood to make the penis erect. All three are wrapped together by a tough fibrous sheath known as the tunica albuginea. When you’re having intercourse, the blood flowing to your penis makes it straight, stiff and hard, and able to penetrate. Semen then exits through the urethra after orgasm. This process is called ejaculation.  Peyronie's disease treatment in india  Peyronie's disease is now available in india. Dr Ashish Saini is the best Urologist and Sexologist in India.
